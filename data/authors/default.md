After various professional experiences in different fields, I was looking for new challenges. I became very attracted to AI and IoT and how it has the potential to impact our societies. I started to learn programming and digital marketing by myself.

Then, thanks to this knowledge, I joined a small Japanese company using image recognition technology and IoT. I rapidly got involved in product development as a designer and marketer. Writing blog articles on the IoT industry, organizing booths are different exhibitions, etc inspired me a lot about this industry.

In September 2020, I founded zeteoh, Inc. At zeteoh, currently we are developing product by using TinyML.
